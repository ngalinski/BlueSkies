"Notes: All data weighted to reflect the national population ages 0-64 and covered by ESI. Data for 2016 and 2017 adjusted using actuarial completion. All per person dollars from allowed amounts. Prescription drug spending is the amount paid on the pharmacy claim, which reflects discounts from the wholesale price, but not manufacturer rebates paid in separate transactions. Prescriptions not categorizable as brand or generic are not included in the table due to low dollar amounts.",,,,,,,,,,,
