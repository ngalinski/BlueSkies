Prescription drug spending is the amount paid on the pharmacy claim, which reflects discounts from the wholesale price, but not manufacturer rebates paid in separate transactions. Prescriptions not categorizable as brand or generic are not included in the table due to low dollar amounts.",,,,,,,,,,,
